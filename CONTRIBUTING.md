2. Follow project-specific setup instructions in each repository's README
3. Install dependencies
4. Run tests to ensure everything works

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test across different environments when applicable
- Include integration tests for complex features

### Code Review Process

1. Submit your pull request
2. Automated checks will run (when configured)
3. Community members will review your changes
4. Address feedback and iterate
5. Once approved, maintainers will merge your PR

## RFC Process

For significant changes, feature proposals, or architectural decisions, use our RFC (Request for Comments) process. See [RFC/README.md](RFC/README.md) for details.

## Release Process

- We follow semantic versioning (SemVer)
