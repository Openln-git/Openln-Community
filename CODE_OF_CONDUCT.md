## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Reporting

1. **For urgent issues**: Contact community leaders directly
2. **For general concerns**: Open a private issue or contact maintainers
3. **For code-related issues**: Use the standard issue reporting process

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### Investigation Process

1. Reports will be acknowledged within 48 hours
2. Community leaders will investigate thoroughly
3. All parties involved will have a chance to provide their perspective
4. Decisions will be made fairly and transparently
