# RFC: [Brief Title]

- **RFC ID**: [Will be assigned by maintainers]
- **Start Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Author(s)**: [Your name(s) and GitHub handle(s)]
- **Status**: Draft | Under Review | Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn | Implemented

## Summary

Brief explanation of the feature or change. This should be a single paragraph that clearly describes what you're proposing.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

This section should clearly explain:
- The problem you're trying to solve
- Why existing solutions are inadequate
- What benefits this change will provide
- Who will benefit from this change

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the project to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement.

This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

### API Design

If applicable, show the proposed API:

```
// Example code demonstrating the API
```

### Implementation Details

- How will this be implemented?
- What components will be affected?
- What are the key algorithms or data structures?
- How will this integrate with existing code?

### Examples

Provide examples of how this feature would be used:

```
// Example 1: Basic usage

// Example 2: Advanced usage

// Example 3: Edge cases
```

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- Implementation cost and complexity
- Impact on existing users
- Maintenance burden
- Learning curve for new users
- Performance implications
- Potential for misuse

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

This section could also include:
- Alternative implementation approaches
- Different API designs
- Workarounds that exist today
- How other projects solve this problem

## Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

This can include:
- Similar features in other projects
- Research papers or academic work
- Industry standards or best practices
- Previous attempts to solve this problem

## Unresolved Questions

What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?

What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?

What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future Possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project as a whole. Try to use this section to more fully consider other possible interactions with the project in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

## Implementation Plan

If this RFC is accepted, how do you plan to implement it?

- [ ] Phase 1: [Description]
- [ ] Phase 2: [Description]
- [ ] Phase 3: [Description]

### Timeline

What is the expected timeline for implementation?

### Resources Required

What resources (people, time, infrastructure) are needed?

### Risk Assessment

What are the main risks and how will they be mitigated?

## Success Metrics

How will we know this RFC has been successful?

- Adoption metrics
- Performance improvements
- User feedback
- Community engagement
